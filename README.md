This project takes in a transcript from the user in the first box, and words to ignore in that script in the second box, then runs it through the backend springboot service to count how many times each word has been used. 

It returns the words and their count in box three. From there you can see the results from greatest to least or least to greatest by clicking on the arrows next to either word or count.
